                     <h1>About.</h1>
                    <p>I consider myself a talented designer and a knowledgeable developer of digital experiences. I sincerely enjoy learning about the web industry and delight in creating pleasant and accessible experiences for all to enjoy. My inspirations are drawn from a variety of sources and influences.</p>

                     <h2>Process</h2>
                    <p>My process is ever evolving and with each project I make effort to learn something new.</p>
                    <p>Throughout my career, I’ve compiled my process to these main steps: Learn, Prototyping, Design, Deliver and Learn Some More.</p>

                     <h3>Learning</h3>
                    <p>With every project I learn as much as possible about the client requirements. Things like demographics, purpose and function, goals and flow are items I like to learn about as early in the project as possible. High-level concepts tend to form the base of the project and how the project materializes so I find it most efficient to learn these items early on.</p>
                    <p>I perform as much research as possible in tandem with the learning stage, outlining any objectives and solutions that may help achieve our goal. Objectives: Sitemaps, Map User Flow, User Persona </p>

                     <h3>Wireframing and Prototyping</h3>
                    <p>Wireframing for me starts with quick and simple drawings. I create numerous thumbnails in the attempt to build out multiple solutions to singular objective. I find the more I sketch, the better the end results are. It allows for exploration of solutions to a main objective without committing to anything specific.</p>
                    <p>My prototypes are built in a variety of tools; I’m well-versed in a number of programs. A list of software and programs I tend to use are:</p>
                    <ul class="generic-list" >
                        <li>PhotoShop</li>
                        <li>Illustrator</li>
                        <li>InDesign</li>
                        <li>Adobe XD</li>
                        <li>Sketch</li>
                        <li>InVision</li>
                        <li>Omnigraffle</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>During the prototyping and wireframing step, I start to seek feedback from project managers, designers and especially other developers (back-end and front-end). I find it crucial to explore solutions with as many teammates as possible.</p>
                    <p>Objectives: Page Layout, Communicate tech solutions, reveal/solve any issues</p>
